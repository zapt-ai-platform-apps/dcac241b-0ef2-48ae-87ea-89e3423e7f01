# Persistent Settings

Retain your personal settings (contrast and voice speed) between sessions for a consistent experience.

## Step-by-step

1. Navigate to "Settings" in the top navigation bar.
2. Wait briefly while the app loads your current settings from the server (you'll see a loading state).
3. Adjust "خيارات التباين" (contrast option) to your preference. 
4. Adjust "سرعة الصوت" (voice speed) to whatever suits you best. 
5. Click the "حفظ" button to store your settings on the server. 
6. Your settings are now persistent — on next login, the app will automatically apply your chosen contrast and voice speed.
