# Login

## Step-by-step

1. When you first open the application, if you're not logged in, you will see a "Sign in with ZAPT" heading and a link to the ZAPT website.
2. Below that, you'll see a Supabase authentication form where you can enter your credentials or choose a social login if available.
3. After a successful login, the interface will automatically update without refreshing the page, and you can access all app features.
4. If you need to sign out, there's a "Sign Out" button in the navigation bar. Clicking it returns you to the login screen.
